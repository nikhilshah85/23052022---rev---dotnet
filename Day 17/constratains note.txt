1. DDL statemente


	create table BranchInfo
	(
		brNo int primary key,
		brName varchar(20),
		brCity varchar(20),
		brEmail varchar(30), -- they need to be unique, no duplication
		brContact varchar(20)
	)


	create table AccountsInfo
	(
		accNo int,
		accName varchar(20),
		accType varchar(20),
		accBalance float,
		accBranch int
	)

5 In build constratints in SQL Server
	Primary Key - this will ensure unique value for the column
		      this is used to identify the record
		      this will not allow duplicate values
		      you can have only 1 primary key per table (1 primary can be based on multiple col called 								as concantenated key)
	Not null
		   - this will make sure, column will not allow null value, blank value
		   - just use this keyword next to column name
	check 
	unique key
		   - this will ensure unique value for the column
		   - this is not used to identify a record
		   - you can create multiple unique keys in a table
		   - you can also have combination of 2 columns as unique
	foreign key

		we can disable/enable the constraint
		we can delete teh constraint
		we can modify the constraint

		to do so, we need to know the name of the constraint,
