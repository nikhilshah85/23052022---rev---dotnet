			1. .Net and different types of applications it allows to create
			2. C# - data types, variables, conditions, loops
			3. OOPS - Abstraction, Encapsalation, Inheritance, Polymprphism
				polymprphism  - virtual in parent
						overides in child
			4. Commands - ls, cd, rm, cat, mkdir, grep, pwd, touch, 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

			1. Overloading
				difference between overloading and polymorphism
				params keyword (params Array)
			2. ENUM
			3. var keyword
			4. 2-tier architecture - theory and them practical
	5. constructor - an method which gets called on creation of new object at runtime in memory
			6. FileIO (your first .net framework inbuilt api)

		Overloading - is same method name, with different parameters / different datatypes / different sequence of parameters - only the name is Same

		does not need inheritance



		Polymorphism - is same method name, same return type, same parameters, same sequence of 				parameters		
	
			happen only when you have inheritance


----------------------------------------------------------------
		Some Authors / Blogs - says Polymprphism are of 2 types
			a. Static  
			b. Dynamic

		Polymorpic  - means dynamic at runtime

		---
		Name mangaling is a Compiler feature, which many authors refers to Static polymorphism
