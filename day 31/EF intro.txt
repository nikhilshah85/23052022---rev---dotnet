			EF - Entity Framework is based on Design Pattern - 
			ORM - Object Relational Mapping
				You will have a class (in c# it is called as POCO class - Plain Object on C#)
					will map to a table in database
					class will have properties, which will map to columns in ur table

				Every table will be mapped to 1 class

			------------
			1. lets say we have 3 tables 
						 and so 3 classes

			2. This 5 classes will be under 1 umbrella - called as Context Class, which is mapped to a database,
				it has a connection string - which has servername, databse, user id, password, constraints etc...

			3. Context class has a property - DbSet<Products>, DbSet<Orders> etc..
			
			4. Context class will open the connection to server, close the connection to server
				execute the queries

	
			EF Use LINQ as a language to communicate with databases
			

			Language Integrated Query - an common languge for any kind of managed data source
